0x1E. C - Search AlgorithmsLinear Search is a method for searching an element in a collection of elements. In Linear Search, each element of the collection is visited one by one in a sequential fashion until the desired element is found or all elements have been checked2. It is considered the most basic of all search algorithms1.

Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found3. It is more efficient than linear search but requires the array to be sorted4.

The best search algorithm to use depends on your specific needs and the nature of your data. For example, if youâ€™re working with a small or unsorted dataset, a linear search could be efficient and easy to implement. However, for larger or sorted datasets, more efficient algorithms like binary search would be more appropriate5. Other factors to consider include the complexity of the algorithm, the structure of your data, and the resources available for the search operation
