0x13. C - More singly linked lists
A singly linked list is a data structure used in computer science to organize and store a collection of elements called nodes. Each node in a singly linked list contains two parts: data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list. Unlike a doubly linked list, which has references to both the next and previous nodes, a singly linked list only has references to the next node.

Here's a basic overview of the key components and operations associated with singly linked lists:

Node: Each node in a singly linked list contains two fields:

Data: This field stores the actual value or data of the node.
Next: This field is a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list. It indicates the link between nodes.
Head: The head of the list is a reference to the first node in the list. It serves as the starting point for accessing the list.

Operations:

Insertion:
Insert at the beginning: This operation involves creating a new node, setting its data, and updating the "next" reference to point to the current head. Then, the head is updated to point to the new node.
Insert at the end: To insert a node at the end of the list, you traverse the list until you reach the last node (i.e., the node with a "next" reference pointing to null). Then, you update the "next" reference of the last node to point to the new node.
Insert at a specific position: To insert a node at a specific position, you traverse the list until you reach the node just before the desired position, update its "next" reference to point to the new node, and set the new node's "next" reference to the node that was originally at the desired position.
Deletion:
Delete from the beginning: To remove the first node, update the head to point to the second node.
Delete from the end: To remove the last node, traverse the list until you reach the second-to-last node, and set its "next" reference to null.
Delete from a specific position: To delete a node from a specific position, traverse the list until you reach the node just before the desired position, and update its "next" reference to skip the node at the desired position.
Search: To find a specific value in the list, you start at the head and traverse the list, comparing the data in each node until you find a match or reach the end of the list.
Traversal: You can traverse the entire list by starting at the head and following the "next" references until you reach the end (i.e., the node with a "next" reference pointing to null).
Singly linked lists are useful for scenarios where you need efficient insertions and deletions at the beginning of the list, but they are less efficient for random access operations since you must traverse the list from the beginning to access a specific element.
